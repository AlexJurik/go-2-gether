# Go2Gether

Go2Gether application was created during Hackathon for 24 hours. Our team of 2 people managed to build an MVP of carpooling application, which could help to make a situation on the roads and parking places better. The idea to share a place in a car with passagiers when routs are matching. 
App is cross platform buildable, Android APK could be found [here](https://github.com/Sanch9s/go2gether-apk).
